Prerequisites
Before using the system, please ensure the following prerequisites are met:

How to Use
Follow the steps below to set up and run the system:

Step 1: Install Dependencies
To install the required dependencies:

Open the install.bat file using the Command Prompt or simply double-click on it.
This is a one-time process that sets up a virtual environment and installs the necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

Run the run.bat file by double-clicking it.
This will automatically activate the virtual environment and launch the system.



Additional Information
-> Virtual Environment: The system uses a virtual environment to ensure package isolation. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your machine.
-> Automated Setup: The install.bat script is designed to streamline the setup process, allowing you to focus on using the system without manually managing dependencies.
-> System Requirements: This setup has been optimized for Windows systems. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed for optimal performance.



Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the system:

Verify that Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
Ensure the requirements.txt file is located in the same directory as install.bat.
If you experience any problems, try running the .bat files via Command Prompt to see detailed error messages.
